## Intro

Here is the introduction from [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat):

**GitHub Copilot Chat is a chat interface that lets you interact with GitHub Copilot, 
to ask and receive answers to coding-related questions within GitHub.com and 
supported IDEs. The chat interface provides access to coding information and 
support without requiring you to navigate documentation or search online forums.**

## RStudio

RStudio's integration with Copilot needs to be enabled, and setup, in order
for `chattr` to work. This is due to the complexity of authenticating with 
Copilot Chat. 

If you have not yet setup GitHub Copilot in your RStudio IDE, here are the 
instructions: https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html

## Test connection 

Use the `chattr_test()` function to confirm that your connection works:

``` r
library(chattr)

chattr_use("copilot")

chattr_test()
